# CSC705-Service_Oriented_Computing

NC State University. CSC 705 - Service Oriented Computing

These are all the projects I had to do for the class. They each have the project requirements of what I had to do and how to run the projects.

You will need the following to run the most of the projects:

- JDK 8 or higher (required)
- sbt (ver 1.2.1 or higher) [tested with ver 1.2.8]
- Play (ver 2.6.18 or higher) [Donâ€™t need to download manually, installed with sbt]

The requirements pdf for each project will have additional software to download specific to that project.

*If downloaded directly, the projects may not not run, so you may need to create new Play projects and then copy the code over.

CSC750 - Project3

- I wrote my code and tested it on windows. 
- There were times when the REST call would hang and would and there was no output on the server. To fix this, I would have to 
press another key (like the arrow keys) while I am on the server window and then it would print out what it should and complete the REST call. 
- I am not sure why this happens. I wanted to let you know that this might happen when grading the project (similar to Project 1). 
- I don't want to lose point for something that was out of my control.
